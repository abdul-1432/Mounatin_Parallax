## Customization

You can easily customize the Mountain Parallax Effect to fit your project or personal preferences. Here are some ways you can do it:

- **Changing Mountains Images**: Replace the mountain images in the `images` folder with your own images or images that fit your project theme. Make sure to maintain the image dimensions for the best parallax effect.

- **Adjusting Parallax Speed**: You can control the parallax effect speed by adjusting the `data-parallax-speed` attribute on the mountain image elements. Higher values will make the mountains scroll faster, while lower values will slow them down.

- **Styling**: Modify the CSS in the `styles.css` file to customize the overall look and feel of the parallax effect, such as background colors, font styles, and other design elements.

- **Adding Content**: Feel free to add additional content, such as text, buttons, or other elements, to the `index.html` file to enhance the user experience.
